# w3schools C++ Tutorial

This folder contains the code that I generated as I learnt C++ at [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp)

## Contents

1. [Hello World](./hello-world.cpp)
2. [User Input](./user-input.cpp)
3. [Data Types](./data-types.cpp) [I skipped most of the other tutorials because they are something I already know from JavaScript and so many other tutorials]
4. [Classes](./classes.cpp)
