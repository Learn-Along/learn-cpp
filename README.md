# Learn C++

This is a bunch of files created as I master C++. It might be useful to anyone looking to master C++ and become a low-level programmer

## Environment

These have been built using:

- Compiler: gcc
- OS: Ubuntu 16.04
- Code Editor: Visual Studio Code

## How to run the code

Using the environment above and with gcc installed (see [instructions](https://rupinderjeetkaur.wordpress.com/2014/06/20/run-a-cc-program-on-terminal-using-gcc-compiler/)):

1. Create the bin folder on the root of this project

    ```bash
    mkdir bin
    ```

2. Build the code

    ```bash
    g++ -o [desired path to output file] [filepath]
    ```

    e.g.

    ```bash
    g++ -o bin/hello-world w3schools-tutorial/hello-world.cpp
    ```

3. Run the output file

    ```bash
    [desired path to output file]
    ```

    e.g.

    ```bash
    bin/hello-world
    ```
